officialworkoutapp folder contains the front-end web application,
written in React, Apollo and Foundation.

workoutappserver folder contains the server-side application,
written in NodeJS, GraphQL and Sequelize (for a Postgres data store).

Note: Initially I had written the front-end application using React/Redux
with a REST API on the back-end, but I have now moved to React/Apollo
with a GraphQL API (Sequelize and Postgres are still there).
